### a Java algorithm that reverses the order of elements in a queue using a stack and a single element variable
> Let Q be a non-empty queue, and let S be an empty stack. Using only the
stack and queue ADT functions and a single element variable X, write an
algorithm to reverse the order of the elements in Q.
